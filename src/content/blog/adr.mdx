## Context

Should I dip into my already limited spare time to create and maintain a website to host my
incoherent ramblings? 

## Decision
Sure, why not?

## Alternatives

1. Doomscroll and Netflix my evenings away
2. Actually finish the 5 renovation projects that have been ongoing for a years
3. Level yet another alt in World of Warcraft
4. Exercise (lol)

## Consequences
Alas alternatives 1-4 will continue to wait.
