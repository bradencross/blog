In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating a modern blog website using Astro.js and Cursor IDE. We'll cover everything from initial setup to deploying your blog.

## Why Astro.js?

Astro.js is a modern static site builder that offers several advantages for blog creation:

- **Performance**: Astro delivers lightning-fast performance by shipping less JavaScript to the browser
- **Content-focused**: Built-in support for Markdown and MDX
- **Flexibility**: Use your favorite UI components and frameworks
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent developer tools and hot module replacement

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a New Project

First, let's create a new Astro project using Cursor. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

When prompted, choose the following options:
- Project name: your-blog-name
- Template: Blog
- TypeScript: Yes
- Install dependencies: Yes

### 2. Project Structure

After installation, your project will have this basic structure:

```
your-blog-name/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── styles/
├── public/
└── package.json
```

### 3. Adding Bulma for Styling

To add Bulma to your project, run:

```bash
npm install bulma
```

Then create a global CSS file at `src/styles/global.css`:

```css
@import 'bulma/css/bulma.min.css';

/* Custom styles */
body {
    background-color: #1a1a1a;
    color: #ffffff;
}

.navbar {
    background-color: #2a2a2a !important;
}

/* Add more custom styles as needed */
```

### 4. Creating Blog Posts

Blog posts are stored in the `src/content/blog` directory. You can write posts in Markdown or MDX format. Here's an example structure:

```markdown
---
title: 'Your Post Title'
description: 'A brief description of your post'
pubDate: 'Mar 19 2024'
heroImage: '../../assets/your-image.jpg'
---

Your post content goes here...
```

### 5. Customizing the Layout

The main layout components are:
- `src/components/Header.astro`: Navigation bar
- `src/layouts/BlogPost.astro`: Blog post template
- `src/pages/index.astro`: Home page

### 6. Using Cursor's AI Features

Cursor IDE offers powerful AI features that can help you:
- Generate code snippets
- Debug issues
- Refactor code
- Get instant answers to programming questions

To use these features:
1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` to open the AI command palette
